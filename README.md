Bird Classification with Transfer Learning (TensorFlow)

Two image-classification pipelines in TensorFlow/Keras:

Birds vs Squirrels — 3-class baseline with Xception, rapid convergence on a small balanced set.

Birder — fine-grained 358-class bird species classifier with InceptionV3, two-phase fine-tuning and Top-K metrics.
